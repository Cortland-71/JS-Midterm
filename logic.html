                        <p>Now that you know how to create a simple Java program using notepad and CMD, it's time to switch over to an actual development environment. A IDE or Integrated Developer Environment like Eclipse will allow you to write Java programs, compile and run them all in one easy window.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Download <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a></p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Having an IDE to write code in makes the process much easier. You can organize and view all of your projects and files in one location. One of the most usefull aspects of using an IDE over a normal text editor is IntelliSense and autofill. IntelliSense allows you to view various options as you type to give you availible suggestions. Autofill allows you to tab compleate so you can spend less time typing! Among these features there are a host of various styling options, debugging tools and documentation abilities that professional programmers rely on.

                        Next we're going to take a look at a fundemental concept in all of programming. The variable. A variable is really nothing more than a bucket that can hold data. For example if I said something like (a = 3) you would probably asume that the value of (a) is now (3) yes? In this case (a) is our variable and (3) is our value. So I could say something like (a + a) and you would understand this to equate to the number 6. Variables can change to something else of course but in Java it's importaint to remember that the kind of data that can be stored in a variable must be mentioned explicitly.

                    <div class="explination">
                        <h2 class="sub-title">Integers</h2>
                        <p>In Java you must define the type of variable you are making. In this example let's look at one of the most commonly used types, the int. int stands for Integer and notice that it is lower case. int can hold positive or negative whole number between a specific amount. When creating a variable you must tell the compiler what type of variable you are making. You can also assign a value to the variable in the same line as shown below.</p>
