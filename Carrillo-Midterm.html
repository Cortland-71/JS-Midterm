                        Java is a widely used programming language expressly designed for use in the distributed
                        environment of the internet. It is the most popular programming language for Android smartphone
                        applications and is also among the most favored for the development of edge devices and the
                        internet of things.

                        Java was designed to have the look and feel of the C++ programming language, but is simpler to
                        use and enforces an object-oriented programming model. Java can be used to create complete
                        applications that may run on a single computer or be distributed among servers and clients in a
                        network. It can also be used to build a small application module or applet for use as part of a
                        webpage. Java is easy to write and easy to run—this is the foundational strength of Java and why
                        many developers program in it. When you write Java once, you can run it anywhere at any time.

                        It's okay if you didnt. The idea here is to get you familiar with some of the core concepts of
                        Java and programming in general. Not understanding some of the finer details at this point is
                        perfectly fine. If you're new to programming don't worry. Java is a great first language to
                        learn since it's core concepts will easily translate to other languages.

                        Alright, now that we have installed java and saw the version numbers in CMD, let's actually get to coding! It's tradition to write a "hello, world" program when learning any new language so let's do that. Keep in mind that some of the syntax you write won't make any sense right now, that's okay! As you play you'll begin to pick up on what does what and by the end of these series of tutorials you'll be able to write some simple but usable applications.

                        <p>The first thing to to notice about this code is line 1. This is a single line comment. Anything after the // on the same line will be seen as a comment.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>On line 3 is where the class starts. Don't worry to much about this right now, just know that the name of the class must be the same as the file! Also note at the end of this line is a opening curley brace. The closing curley is on line 9. Anything inside these curley braces are considered part of the class.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>One line 5 is where the main method starts. For now, know that the main method is where the program begins execution. Note the curley brace at the end of the line 5, this is the opening curley brace for the main method and ends on line 8. Anything between these curley braces will be executed.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Line 7 is the only thing in our main method. In this case it will print out "Hello, world!" to the console and then the program will end.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>Next we'll look at logic and variables so we can start having the program make decisions.</p>
